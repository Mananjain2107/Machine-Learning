#  KNN Classification - Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using **scikit-learn** to predict heart disease.

The objective of this project is to understand distance-based classification, feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning, and building a clean machine learning pipeline.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- Dataset: Heart Disease Dataset
- Problem Type: Binary Classification

Target Variable:
- 0 → No Heart Disease
- 1 → Heart Disease

Features include medical attributes such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
